/* Idea : have a logger class to create log files

The logger is attached to a CharmmContext, and should report:
 - the CharmmContext params/variables (outside of the large arrays),
 - the ForceManager attached to it,
 - upon integration, the Integrator params, and the integration description
(nsteps...)
 - the name of input files used ?

The logger would be called by the Integrator upon propagating many steps (not
through PropagateOneStep).

Should be created upon initialization of a CharmmContext ?


needs an output file name (obv), with good default if nothing provided.

Should report variables / parameters from :
- the integrator : this means that every child class needs its own logger
specific function ?
- the CharmmContext
- the ForceManager: long term, if we want to handle Composite, we'll need to
think about that too.

Every main class could have a "log" function, to enable the logger output to be
adapted to every class (ex: params for Langevin Piston are not the same as
Langevin Thermostat)

TODO:
- add version number to the log file,
- possibly commit hash ?
- xml (or yaml ? or json?) output format  */
